```terraform
# Local .terraform directories and state files
.terraform/
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.backup
*.tfvars
*.auto.tfvars

# Terraform plan and output files
*.plan
*.out

# Sensible variables and secrets
*.auto.tfvars
secrets.auto.*
*.key
*.pem

# Logs
*.log
```

Wait, I need to reconsider. The added files are only Terraform configuration files (.tf) and a README.md. These are source/configuration files, not build artifacts, dependencies, or temporary files that should be ignored. Following rule #6, if the changes contain only source/config files and no build artifacts, dependencies, or temp files, I should output nothing.
